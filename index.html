                        <p>A coffee shop is a kind of restaurant that sells coffee, tea, cakes, and sometimes sandwiches
                              and
                              light meals.It gives a restaurant the platform to tell their own story, in their own words
                              Coffee shops are part of the specialty eatery industry, which also includes outlets
                              specializing
                              in products such as bagels, donuts, frozen yogurt, and ice cream.</p>

                        <h4>neumorphism website</h4>
                        <p>Neumorphism and it's a style that relies heavily on using shadows to achieve an almost
                              floating-like effect on the elements in your website or mobile application. Neumorphic
                              design is
                              also known as soft design.Neumorphism might not catch on, but maybe some of its elements
                              will end up being incorporated in flat design. It could also possibly inspire another
                              trend. All we know is that, right now, flat design is the standard, but we can always
                              iterate and improve on it.</p>
